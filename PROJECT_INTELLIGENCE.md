# Project Intelligence for Ableton Tracklist Exporter

Generated on 2025-10-13T03:05:54.516Z.

## Summary

The Ableton-Tracklist-Exporter is a functional, albeit simple, tool for extracting tracklists from Ableton Live set files. It's a niche project with potential for growth, but currently lacks significant community engagement and advanced features. The project is actively maintained.

## Key Insights

- **Limited Community Engagement**: The project has very low community engagement (1 star, 0 forks/watchers). This suggests limited visibility and potential for organic growth. Consider promoting the project to relevant communities (e.g., Reddit's r/DJs, music production forums).
- **Outdated Technology Stack**: Using ES5 and older tools like Bower might limit the project's maintainability and scalability. Consider migrating to modern JavaScript (ES6+) and more current tooling for improved developer experience and access to newer libraries.
- **Potential for Expansion**: The project has clear potential for expansion with features like support for other DAWs and cloud storage. This could significantly increase its value proposition.
- **Maintenance Stability**: The latest push date (2025-10-13) indicates active maintenance.  Ensure consistent testing and documentation updates to maintain stability.

## Suggested Actions

- **Promote Project Visibility**: Share the repository on relevant online communities (Reddit, Discord servers focused on music production/DJing) and social media platforms to increase visibility.
- **Modernize Technology Stack**: Evaluate migrating to ES6+ and updating tooling (e.g., using Yarn instead of Bower) for improved maintainability and developer experience.
- **Prioritize Feature Development**: Based on user feedback (if available), prioritize adding support for other DAW formats and exploring cloud storage integration.
- **Improve Documentation**: Ensure the README.md and PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md are comprehensive, up-to-date, and clearly explain how to use the exporter.
